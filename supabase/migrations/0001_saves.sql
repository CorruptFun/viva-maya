-- Minimal per-user cloud save
--
-- The smallest thing that works: ONE row per user holding the entire game
-- SaveData blob as JSON. There is no currency, ledger or wallet table in this
-- schema -- chips and stars are values inside that blob with no monetary
-- meaning. Score validation is not here either; the guard triggers that
-- constrain what a client may file arrive with the leaderboard, from 0002 on.
--
-- Security model: Row Level Security (RLS) restricts every row to its owner
-- (auth.uid() = user_id). The Supabase anon / public key is safe to ship in
-- the client precisely because these policies gate all access -- the key only
-- ever grants what RLS allows for the currently signed-in user.
--
-- This migration is written to be idempotent-friendly (safe to re-run): it
-- uses CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS and DROP ... IF EXISTS before each CREATE.

-- RLS POLICIES
-- A signed-in user may read/write ONLY their own row (auth.uid() = user_id).
-- No policy grants access to other users' rows, and the anon role matches
-- none of these (auth.uid() is null when unauthenticated), so cross-user and
-- anonymous access are denied.
